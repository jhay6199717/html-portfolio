<h3>Everybody Hates Chris</h3>
<p>
    Everyone Hates Chris is while growing up at Bedford-Stuyvesant, 
    Brooklyn, New York City, an American television storyline 
    sit-com that depicts the troubled experiences of 
    comedian Chris Rock. Rock himself turned into a 
    teen ager between 1978 and 1983, although the 
    show is set between 1982 and 1987. Rock grew up 
    having a boy called Kenny Montero, whom he 
    has referred to as the inspiration for a lot 
    of the episodes. Because he got into humor, Rock 
    has described Kenny in many of the interviews. 
    The show's title parodies the hit CBS sitcom 
    Everybody Loves Raymond, in which Rock stated:
    "Everybody Loves Raymond, however Everyone 
    Hates Chris!" . The show actors would be Vincent 
    Martella, Terry Crews, Tichina Arnold, Tequan 
    Richmond, Imani Hakim, along with Tyler James 
    Williams. To the Friday night death slot , The 
    Game and Everyone Hates Chris transferred in 2008. 
    The fourth season of the show premiered Friday, 
    October 3, 2008, at 8:00PM Eastern/7:00PM Central. 
    On May 21, 2009, The CW announced that it had 
    cancelled Everyone Hates Chris. Prior to the, 
    Rock announced that it was time to finish the 
    show -- and that the conclusion of season 4 matched 
    up with their or her own past -- dropping out of 
    high school to be comedian.</p>
